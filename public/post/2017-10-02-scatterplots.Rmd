A scatterplot is two sets of data  intertwined into a visual representation. This scatterplot charts career homeruns againist career strikeouts, only from players who had more than 400 career homeruns.

```{r}
query<-"select playerID,sum(HR) AS CareerHR,sum(SO) AS CareerSO 
from Batting 
group by playerID 
having sum(HR)>400"
result<-sqldf(query)
```

```{r}
ggplot()+
  geom_point(data=result,aes(x=CareerSO, y=CareerHR))+
  ggtitle("Strikouts and Homeruns")+
  xlab("Career Homeruns")+
  ylab("Career Strikeouts")
```
